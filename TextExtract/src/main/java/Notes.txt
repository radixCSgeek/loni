Parsing:

xxxxx Use AutoDetectParser for first cut with config.xml that specifies which types to use OITParser for. 
This should work fine because of the use of the application/x.oitdriver.... type specification

Future enhancement would be to write a specialized composite parser that uses Context & stats to decide when to use which parser.

--This might be useful, but might not be needed now. Just use config.xml to overrride the default behavior if we need Tika parsing to handle an OIT type

File Typing:

Use the DefaultDetector for the first cut <--- This should work fine as long as the x.oitdriver types will be "more precise"
Future enhancement would be to create a custom detector that compares the results of multiple file typers <--- probably not needed

Language Detection:

Create LangID interface that returns language + confidence pairs.
Calculate average confidence for each language
Use highest confidence language

(possibly averaging won't work ... may need to fall back to relying on which approaches are best for length of text)


Detect language on entire document, plus each paragraph / section. Also generate composite language score based on paragraphs. 
(i.e. we can give a lot more meta data about the languages detected)
